'''
Challenge: The program template below is a program designed to run two independent timers 
with their own start and stop buttons. In particular, each timer should be controlled by its 
own buttons independent of the other timer's buttons. The current version has an error that causes 
both timers to work in unison. Find and fix this 
error.
